# Huginn

Huginn is a Norse‑mythology–inspired micro‑story board application where users can anonymously post short stories, wander through realms of content, and observe the murmurs of a community without revealing their identity. Named after one of Odin’s ravens, the app collects thoughts and releases them into a shared sky.

## ✨ Features

* **Anonymous micro‑story posting** — Write, share, and scroll without revealing your identity.
* **Dark/Light mode** — Fully stylized switching, including scrollbars, icons, and modal behavior.
* **Comment system** — Users may leave comments on every post, anonymously of course.
* **Reaction system** — Alternatively, users can give pre-determined reactions according to their mood.
* **Category filtering** — Filter stories by tags like *Mythology*, *Dark*, *Politics*, etc.
* **Responsive design** — Clean layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
